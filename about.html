Floodwatch — Bellbrook Bridge
What this is

Floodwatch is a public, real-time bridge safety display for Bellbrook Bridge.

It answers one question only:

Can I safely cross the bridge right now?

It does this by showing:

Current river height

Calculated clearance between water and bridge deck

A clear human-readable status (Safe / Unsafe)

No interpretation required. No login. No alerts. No authority needed.

Why Floodwatch exists

Existing flood information systems provide:

River heights

Forecasts

Warnings

Maps

What they do not provide is the one piece of information people actually need at the bridge:

How much water is between the river and the road deck.

That omission forces people to:

Guess

Rely on rumours

Drive out to check

Or trust warnings that are not specific to the crossing they are standing at

Floodwatch exists to close that gap.

What Floodwatch deliberately does NOT do

This is intentional, not a limitation.

Floodwatch does not:

Forecast future conditions

Model scenarios

Send alerts

Accept user input

Infer risk

Make recommendations beyond the present moment

Integrate with vendors, councils, or agencies

Why?

Because each of those introduces:

Delay

Liability deflection

Opaque logic

Or false confidence

Floodwatch shows only what is true now, using publicly available measurements and transparent calculation.

How it works (at a high level)

Uses live river gauge data

Applies a fixed, known bridge deck height

Calculates clearance in metres

Displays the result plainly

There is no hidden logic.
No adaptive thresholds.
No backend authority.

Anyone can check the numbers.

My journey

This system took approximately six months to build.

Not because the idea was complex—but because I had to learn:

How river data is actually published

How to translate raw measurements into a human decision

How to build a public web interface from scratch

How to avoid introducing unsafe assumptions

I am not a council.
I am not a vendor.
I am not an emergency authority.

I am someone who needed this information and realised it was missing.

So I built it.

Who this is for

Floodwatch is for:

Locals who cross the bridge

Emergency responders who need confirmation, not forecasts

Anyone who wants to independently verify conditions

It is not a replacement for warnings or emergency services.
It is a missing layer between raw data and real decisions.

Core principle

Floodwatch exists on one principle:

Withholding simple, actionable information does not increase safety.

Providing it—clearly and without interpretation—does.
