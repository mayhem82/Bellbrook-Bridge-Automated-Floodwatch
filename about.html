        <h2>The Mission</h2>
        <p>This project exists for one reason: to give the Bellbrook community a clear, immediate answer to "Can I cross the bridge?" during high-water events.</p>
        <p>While official data exists, it is often buried in tables or requires manual calculation. This tool automates that process to save time when it matters most.</p>

        <h2>My Journey Building It</h2>
        <p>Living in an area where the bridge is our lifeline, I realized that checking river heights was a repetitive chore for every family in the village. I started by tracking the gauge data manually, but soon realized I could build a "bridge-first" dashboard.</p>
        <p>The journey involved teaching myself how to fetch live data from BOM and Council feeds, building a system to remember the history of the river (the trend graph), and designing a mobile-friendly interface that works even when phone reception is poor during a storm.</p>
        <p>This is a labor of love for Bellbrook—built by a resident, for the residents.</p>
